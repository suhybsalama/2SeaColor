Two-stream remote sensing model for water quality mapping: 2SeaColor

- 2SeaColor is a Matlab/Octave (R will be available soon) code that provides analytical solution of the radiative transfer equation in the water column.
- 2SeaColor treats the direct and diffuse solar radiation separately and derives the depth profile of the downwelling attenuation coefficient   together with inherent optical properties from observed above-water remote sensing reflectance.
- The common high turbidity of inland waters is accounted for in 2SeaColor by projecting its effect on the inherent optical properties (IOPs) using the similarity transform.
