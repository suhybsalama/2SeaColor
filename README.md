# 2SeaColor
Two-stream remote sensing model for water quality mapping: 2SeaColor

- 2SeaColor is a Matlab/Octave (R/Python will be available soon) code that provides analytical solution of the radiative transfer equation in the water column.
- 2SeaColor treats the direct and diffuse solar radiation separately and derives the depth profile of the downwelling attenuation coefficient   together with inherent optical properties from observed above-water remote sensing reflectance.
- The common high turbidity of inland waters is accounted for in 2SeaColor by projecting its effect on the inherent optical properties (IOPs) using the similarity transform. 
The code is provided with test data obtained from radiative transfer simulations, at 30° sun zenith, of synthesized inherent optical properties (IOPs), (Lee, 2006).
